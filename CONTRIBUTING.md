#Contributing
You're more than welcome to contribute to my library. Before you begin, please read [CONDUCT.md](conduct.md)! My two main mechanisms for determining similarity are POS tagging and word length, so if you would like to contribute to either of those go for it. One I also hope to implement is sentence length; that would also be a fantastic place to explore! Thanks in advance for your ideas and input.
(PS documentation help is ALWAYS very appreciated!)
